      <h5 class="description"><span>Having pet has many benefits to its owner specifically on mental health. Pets like dogs and cats can reduce stress, anxiety and depression thanks to their playfulness. Pets also provides good companionship for kids and adults. Well my Favorite pets named Starla half breed of AsPin and Shih Tzu she’s so adorable that is why we always hug her I even put her in my bedroom and slept with her. Also my other favorite dog’s name was Phila from the Patron Saint Sta. Filomena for the reason that she was given to us the same time of the feast day of the Saint, but months after being with us Phila died because of parvo infection but still she was very adorable and playful with every people in the house.</span></h5>
